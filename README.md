# AI_Automation

Iâ€™ve built AI-powered workflows using N8N and Make.com to automate key tasks like resume sorting, lead extraction, and email handling. These automations streamline processes, saving time and boosting efficiency across HR, data analysis, and digital communication.

# N8N

### Description: 
Monitors an email inbox (IMAP) for messages with attachments. Checks if the attachment is a PDF and if the email subject matches a job reference in a Google Sheet. If valid, uses AI to analyze the CV (extract info, calculate experience, score). Logs data to a Sheet and moves/renames the CV in Google Drive based on the score. Sends automated email replies if the attachment isn't PDF or the job reference is missing/invalid.

Watches a Google Drive folder for new PDF resumes. Extracts text, looks up corresponding job details from a Google Sheet (based on filename prefix). Uses AI to analyze the CV, extract candidate info, calculate total experience, and score suitability. Appends details to a central Google Sheet, moves the original CV file to a folder based on suitability score (>70% or <70%), and renames the file.

### Description :
his n8n workflow automates the analysis of assertiveness questionnaire responses. It takes input from a webhook, uses a language model to evaluate the responses and generate a personality profile, creates a pie chart visualization, and produces a styled .doc report with analysis, and stores all generated content in Google Drive.



# Make.com

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e4011fb-3f73-46d2-bc0c-0022f71d713d)

### Description:
This automation scrapes Google search results using Apify's Google Search Scraper actor, waits briefly to ensure data is ready, then fetches the resulting dataset (up to 100 entries) in JSON format. It's ideal for generating lead lists, extracting relevant links, or researching specific topics. You can change the search query ("python" in this case) to target different keywords and collect updated leads automatically.
